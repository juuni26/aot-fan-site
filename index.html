          <p><span class="synopsis">What is AOT ?</span> Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin,
            lit. "The Advancing Giants") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set
            in a world where humanity lives inside cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from the
            gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate
            the Titans after a Titan brings about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. Attack on
            Titan was serialized in Kodansha's monthly shōnen manga magazine Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from September
            2009 to April 2021, with its chapters collected in 34 tankōbon volumes.
            An anime television series was produced by Wit Studio (seasons 1–3) and MAPPA (season 4). A 25-episode first
            season was broadcast from April to September 2013, followed by a 12-episode second season broadcast from
            April to June 2017. A 22-episode third season was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes airing
            from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes airing from April to July 2019. A fourth and final season
            premiered in December 2020, airing 16 episodes in its first part, with the remainder announced to begin
            airing in January 2022.
            Attack on Titan has become a critical and commercial success. As of December 2019, the manga has over 100
            million tankōbon copies in print worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It
            has won several awards, including the Kodansha Manga Award, the Attilio Micheluzzi Award, and Harvey Award.

          <p><span class="synopsis">Synopsis</span> "That day, the human race remembered the terror of being dominated
            by them, and the shame of being held
            captive in a birdcage..." — Over 100 years ago, a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans, giant
            humanoid but mindless monsters whose sole purpose of existence seemed to be to devour humans. There was an
            insurmountable gap in power between them and mankind, and as a result, humanity was rapidly exterminated to
            the brink of extinction. The survivors responded by constructing three concentric walls: Wall Maria, Wall
            Rose and Wall Sina, which graced them with a century of peace. However, one day a Colossal Titan far larger
            than any other seen before breached the outer wall, allowing the smaller Titans to invade the human
            territory and forcing the survivors to retreat to the inner walls. Eren Jaeger, a boy whose mother was eaten
            during the invasion, vowed to wipe every last Titan off the face of the Earth, and joined the military
            determined to exact his revenge.</p>
